Title: 
    Missing Descriptive Response When No Records Exist: Empty Array Returned in GET Request

Description: 
    When the employee table is empty and no records are present, sending a GET request to retrieve the employee list returns an empty array ([]). 
    However, there is no descriptive message indicating that there are no records in the database. 
    A clearer response with a message such as "No employees found" would provide a better user experience and more context.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Ensure the employee table is empty (no records). (You can use "API_all_posts_delete.py python script to empty the table")
    2. Open Postman or any API testing tool.
    3. Send a GET request to the employee list retrieval endpoint(https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/employees).
    4. Observe the response is an empty array ([]).

Expected Result: 
    The server should return a descriptive JSON response, such as:
        {
        "message": "No employees found"
        }

Actual Result: 
    The server returns an empty array ([]), which does not provide clear information to the user about the lack of records.
