Title: 
    GET Request for Non-Existent Employee Returns 200 OK Instead of 404 Not Found

Description: 
    When performing a GET request with a non-existent employee ID, the server responds with a 200 OK status, even though the employee does not exist. 
    The server should return a 404 Not Found status along with a message indicating that the employee could not be found, rather than returning 200 OK for a non-existent resource.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open Postman or any API testing tool.
    2. Send a GET request with a non-existent employee ID:
        GET https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/employees/bdaa0e7d-9282-4aeb-b077-820ea21de226
    3. Observe that the server returns a 200 OK status, even though the employee does not exist.

Expected Result: 
    The server should return a 404 Not Found status with a descriptive error message, such as:
        {
        "error": "Employee not found"
        }

Actual Result: 
    The server returns a 200 OK status with an empty or incorrect response, providing no indication that the employee does not exist.
