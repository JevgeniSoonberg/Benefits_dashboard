Title: 
    Excessive Decimal Places in benefitsCost and net Fields in GET Responses

Description: 
    When performing a GET request to retrieve employee data, the benefitsCost field is returned with 5 decimal places and the net field is returned with 4 decimal places. 
    Since these fields represent monetary values, it is expected that they should be limited to 2 decimal places. 
    This inconsistency could cause confusion and lead to potential rounding errors. 
    The values in the user interface (UI) are correctly rounded to 2 decimal places, but the API response does not reflect this.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open Postman or any API testing tool.
    2. Send a GET request to retrieve employee data:
        https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/employees
    3. Observe the values in the benefitsCost and net fields, which are returned with 5 and 4 decimal places, respectively.

Expected Result: 
    The benefitsCost and net fields should be rounded to 2 decimal places, consistent with standard monetary representation. Example:
        {
        "benefitsCost": 38.46,
        "net": 1961.54
        }

Actual Result: 
    The benefitsCost field is returned with 5 decimal places, and the net field is returned with 4 decimal places:
        {
        "benefitsCost": 38.46154,
        "net": 1961.5385
        }
