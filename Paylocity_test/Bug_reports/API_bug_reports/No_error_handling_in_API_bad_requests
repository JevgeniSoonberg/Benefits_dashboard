Title: 
    Missing Error Handling in bad Requests: No JSON Response on Error

Description: 
    When sending f.e. a POST request with invalid data types (e.g., int in the firstName field), the server correctly returns a 405 Method Not Allowed status code. 
    However, the server does not provide a JSON response with an error message, which makes it unclear to the user why the request failed. 
    Proper error handling and descriptive JSON responses are needed to clarify the cause of the error.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open Postman or any API testing tool.
    2. Send a POST request to the employee creation endpoint(https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/employees) with the following request body:
        {
        "firstName": 123,
        "lastName": "Employee4",
        "dependants": 4
        }
    3. Observe the server returns a 405 Method Not Allowed status but does not include a JSON response that explains the error.

Expected Result: 
    The server should return a descriptive JSON response in the event of an error, clearly explaining why the request failed (e.g., invalid data type for firstName).

Actual Result: 
    The server returns a 405 status code with no JSON response, leaving the user without sufficient information about the cause of the error.
