Title: 
    Empty Response When Deleting an Employee: No Confirmation Message Returned

Description: 
    When successfully deleting an employee, the server responds with a 200 OK status code but provides an empty JSON response. 
    There is no confirmation message indicating that the employee was deleted successfully, which can lead to confusion. 
    A descriptive message should be returned to confirm the successful deletion of the employee.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open Postman or any API testing tool.
    2. Send a DELETE request to delete an existing employee using their ID:
        DELETE https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/employees/{employeeID}
    3. Observe that the server responds with a 200 OK status but no JSON body is returned.

Expected Result: 
    The server should return a confirmation message in the JSON response, such as:
        {
        "message": "Employee successfully deleted"
        }
        
Actual Result: 
    The server returns a 200 OK status, but the response body is completely empty, providing no confirmation that the employee was deleted.
