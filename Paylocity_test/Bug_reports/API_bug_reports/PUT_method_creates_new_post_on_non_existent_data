Title: 
    PUT Method Creates a New Employee Instead of Returning an Error for Non-Existent Records

Description: 
    When attempting to update an employee using the PUT method with non-existent or incorrect data (e.g., an invalid or incorrect id, firstName, or lastName), the system creates a new employee record instead of returning an error indicating that the employee does not exist. 
    This behavior is unexpected, as PUT should only update existing records. 
    If the employee does not exist, the server should return an error message stating that the record cannot be found.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open Postman or any API testing tool.
    2. Send a PUT request with an id that does not correspond to any existing employee or with mismatched data:
        {
        "id": "e987a85e-8364-461a-bcd2-af65adaf30e6",
        "firstName": "test",
        "lastName": "Employee"
        }
    3. Observe that instead of returning an error, the system creates a new employee record with the specified data.

Expected Result: 
    The server should return an error message such as:
        {
        "error": "Employee not found. Cannot update non-existent employee."
        }
    The PUT request should only update existing records and not create new ones.

Actual Result: 
    The server returns a 200 OK status and creates a new employee record with the provided data, even though no employee with the specified id exists.
