Title: 
    Missing Data Validation in POST Requests: Special Characters and Numbers Allowed in First Name and Last Name Fields

Description: 
    The system does not validate the input data for firstName and lastName fields in the POST request when adding a new employee. 
    It is possible to add an employee with special characters and numbers in these fields, which should likely be restricted to ensure data integrity.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open Postman or any API testing tool.
    2. Send a POST request to the employee creation endpoint(https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/employees) with the following request body:
        {
        "firstName": "!%^26",
        "lastName": "Employee%â„–4",
        "dependants": 4
        }
    3. Observe that the employee is successfully added despite the presence of special characters and numbers in the firstName and lastName fields.

Expected Result: 
    The system should validate the firstName and lastName fields to allow only valid characters (e.g., alphabetic characters). 
    An appropriate error message should be returned if the input contains invalid characters such as numbers or special symbols.

Actual Result: 
    The employee is added successfully with special characters and numbers in their firstName and lastName.
