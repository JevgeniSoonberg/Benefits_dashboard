Title: 
    Deleting a Non-Existent Employee Returns 200 OK Instead of an Error

Description: 
    When attempting to delete a non-existent employee by providing an invalid or non-existent ID in the DELETE request, the server responds with a 200 OK status. 
    However, this is misleading, as the employee with the provided ID does not exist. 
    The server should return a more appropriate status code, such as 404 Not Found, with a message indicating that the employee could not be found.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open Postman or any API testing tool.
    2. Send a DELETE request to the following endpoint with a non-existent employee ID:
        https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/api/employees/a5903424-273e-41d2-a573-877a9fe63843
    3. Observe that the server responds with a 200 OK status, even though the employee with the specified ID does not exist.

Expected Result: 
    The server should return a 404 Not Found status, along with a descriptive message such as:
        {
        "error": "Employee not found"
        }

Actual Result: 
    The server returns a 200 OK status, incorrectly indicating that the employee was deleted, even though the employee does not exist.
