Title: 
    Ability to Modify Salary Field via PUT Request: Which may cause negative Net Pay result (No Validation or Error for Negative Net Pay)

Description: 
    The salary field can be modified using the PUT request. 
    This allows users to set unrealistic or incorrect salary values, including values that result in negative net pay. 
    There is no validation or error when setting a salary that results in negative net pay too.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open Postman or any API testing tool.
    2. Send a PUT request to update an existing employee's data and include the salary field with a reduced value:
        {
        "id": "e987a85e-8364-461a-bcd2-af65adaf30e6",
        "firstName": "test",
        "lastName": "Employee",
        "dependants": 0,
        "salary": 50 // Unrealistically low salary
        }
    3. Observe that the system accepts the PUT request and updates the salary.
    4. As a result, net pay may become negative if the salary is too low compared to the deductions (benefits cost).

Expected Result:
    -The salary field should not be modifiable via the PUT request. The server should return an error message if the salary field is included in the request.
    -If salary modification is allowed, the system should validate that the salary does not result in negative net pay and return an error if this occurs.

Actual Result:
    -The system allows the modification of the salary field, even though it should not be editable.
    -No validation is performed for negative net pay, which can occur if the salary is set too low compared to the employee's benefits deductions.
