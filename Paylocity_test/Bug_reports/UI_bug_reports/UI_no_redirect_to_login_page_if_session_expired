Title: 
    No Redirection to Login Page Upon Session Expiration in UI

Description: 
    When a user's session expires in the UI version of the application, the system does not automatically redirect the user to the login page. 
    Instead, the user remains on the current page (https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Benefits), which can lead to confusion, as the user is still on a restricted page without the ability to perform any actions. 
    The user should be redirected to the login page (https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Account/LogIn) when the session expires.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open the application UI at the following URL:
        https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Benefits
    2. Wait for the session to expire.
    3. Observe that the application does not redirect to the login page.
    4. Attempt to interact with the page (e.g., submit a form or access data).
    5. Notice that actions cannot be performed due to the expired session, but no automatic redirection occurs.

Expected Result:
    When the session expires, the application should automatically redirect the user to the login page at:
        https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Account/LogIn

Actual Result:
    The user remains on the Benefits page (https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Benefits) after the session expires, without being notified or redirected to log in again.
