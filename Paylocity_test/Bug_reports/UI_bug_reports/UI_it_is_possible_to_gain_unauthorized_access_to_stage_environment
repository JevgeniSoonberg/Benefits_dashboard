Title: 
    Unauthorized Access to Stage Environment via URL Manipulation

Description: 
    It is possible to gain access to the staging version of the application by modifying the URL to point to the staging environment. 
    A user can change the URL from the production environment (https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Account/Login) to the staging environment (https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Stage/Account/Login) and successfully access it. 
    Access to the test (stage) environment should be restricted, and users authenticated on the production environment should not have access to the staging environment. 
    This creates a potential security risk as users may interact with the test environment when they should not have access.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open the production version of the application at:
        https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Account/Login
    2. Modify the URL to point to the staging environment:
        https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Stage/Account/Login
    3. Observe that the same production account credentials provide access to the staging environment, even though this should not be allowed.

Expected Result:
    -Access to the staging environment should be restricted and require separate authentication or should be entirely inaccessible from production users.
    -Users with access to the production environment should not be able to use their credentials to access the staging environment.

Actual Result:
    The user is able to access the staging environment by modifying the URL, and their production account credentials allow them to log in without restriction.
