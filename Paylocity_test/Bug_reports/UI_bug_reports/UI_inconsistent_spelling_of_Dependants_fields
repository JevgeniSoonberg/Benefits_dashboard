Title: 
    Inconsistent Spelling of "Dependants" Between API and UI

Description: 
    There is an inconsistency in the spelling of the word "Dependants" between the API and the UI. 
    In the API, the column is labeled as "dependants," while in the UI it is labeled as "Dependents." 
    This discrepancy can lead to confusion when using both the API and the UI, as users may not immediately realize that the two terms refer to the same data. 
    To avoid confusion and improve consistency, the spelling should be unified across both the API and UI.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open the API documentation or inspect the API response where the "dependants" field is present.
    2. Observe that the field for the number of dependants is spelled as "dependants" in the API.
    3. Open the UI (https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Benefits) and inspect the field for the number of dependents.
    4. Observe that in the UI, the field is labeled as "Dependents" instead of "Dependants."

Expected Result:
    The spelling of the term "Dependants" should be consistent across both the API and UI to avoid confusion. 
    It should either be standardized as "Dependants" or "Dependents" in both places.

Actual Result:
    The API uses "dependants," while the UI uses "Dependents," causing inconsistency and potential confusion for users interacting with both the API and the UI.
