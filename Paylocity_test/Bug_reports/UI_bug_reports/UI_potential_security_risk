Title: 
    Usage of document.write in UI Poses Potential Security and Performance Risks

Description: 
    The applicationâ€™s UI contains the usage of the document.write method, which is generally considered outdated and poses potential security and performance risks. 
    Specifically, document.write is used for dynamically loading external resources (such as scripts and styles). 
    This method can introduce vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and negatively impact page loading performance.
    More modern and secure alternatives, such as appendChild() or insertBefore(), should be used to dynamically add elements to the DOM.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open the UI of the application.
    2. Inspect the source code and locate instances where document.write is used to load external resources. Example:
        document.write("\u003Cscript src=\u0022/Prod/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js\u0022 crossorigin=\u0022anonymous\u0022 integrity=\u0022...
    3. Observe that the method document.write is used for dynamically loading content.

Expected Result:
    document.write should be avoided due to its potential for introducing security vulnerabilities and performance issues. 
    More secure and efficient alternatives, such as DOM manipulation via appendChild() or insertBefore(), should be used.

Actual Result:
    document.write is used to load external resources, which can expose the application to potential security risks (e.g., XSS attacks) and degrade performance by blocking rendering.
