Title: 
    Access to Benefits Page Without Authentication via "Paylocity Benefits Dashboard" Link

Description: 
    On the login page (https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Account/Login), 
    clicking on the "Paylocity Benefits Dashboard" link redirects the user to the Benefits page (https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Benefits) without requiring authentication. 
    While the user cannot interact with the page, they should not be able to navigate away from the login page until they have successfully logged in. 
    This creates confusion and a potential security issue, as users can reach restricted pages without proper authentication.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open the login page at:
        https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Account/Login
    2. Click on the "Paylocity Benefits Dashboard" link at the top of the page:
        <a class="navbar-brand" href="/Prod/Benefits">Paylocity Benefits Dashboard</a>
    3. Observe that the user is redirected to the Benefits page (https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Benefits) without logging in, although they cannot interact with the page.

Expected Result:
    The user should remain on the login page until they have successfully authenticated with valid credentials.
    Clicking the "Paylocity Benefits Dashboard" link should not allow navigation to the Benefits page without logging in.
Actual Result:
    The user is redirected to the Benefits page without authentication, even though they are not logged in and cannot interact with the page.
