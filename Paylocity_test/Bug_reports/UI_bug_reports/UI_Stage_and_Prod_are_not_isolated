Title: 
    Stage and Production Environments Share Data: Changes in One Environment Reflect in the Other

Description: 
    The Stage and Production environments of the application are not properly isolated, resulting in shared data between them. 
    Any changes made in the Stage environment are reflected in the Production environment, and vice versa. 
    The Stage environment should be a separate test environment with its own isolated data, allowing for testing without affecting live production data. 
    This issue poses a significant risk, as testing activities could unintentionally alter critical production data.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open the Stage version of the application at:
        https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Stage/Benefits
    2. Add or modify employee data.
    3. Open the Production version of the application at:
        https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Benefits
    4. Observe that the changes made in the Stage environment are reflected in the Production environment.

Expected Result:
    -The Stage environment should have separate data, completely isolated from the Production environment. Any changes made in one environment should not affect the other.
    -Testing activities in the Stage environment should not reflect on Production data.

Actual Result:
    Changes made in the Stage environment are visible in the Production environment, and changes made in Production are also visible in Stage.
