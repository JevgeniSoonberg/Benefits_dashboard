Title: 
    No Validation for First Name and Last Name Fields: Numeric and Special Characters Allowed

Description: 
    In the UI version of the application, there is no validation for the First Name and Last Name fields. 
    Users can enter invalid characters, such as numbers and special symbols, which should not be allowed in names. 
    Employee names should only consist of alphabetic characters. Allowing invalid characters could result in incorrect data entry and compromise the integrity of the employee data.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open the application UI at the following URL:
        https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Benefits
    2. Navigate to the form for adding or editing an employee.
    3. In the First Name and Last Name fields, enter invalid characters, such as numbers (123) or special characters (!@#$).
    4. Submit the form.
    5. Observe that the system accepts the invalid names without any validation errors.

Expected Result: 
    The First Name and Last Name fields should validate the input to ensure that only alphabetic characters are allowed. 
    An error message should appear if the user tries to enter numbers or special characters.

Actual Result: 
    The system allows the user to submit invalid names containing numbers or special characters without any validation, resulting in incorrect data entry.
