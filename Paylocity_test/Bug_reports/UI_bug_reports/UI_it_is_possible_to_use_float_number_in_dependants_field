Title: 
    Fractional Numbers Can Be Entered in the Dependants Field in the UI

Description: 
    In the UI version of the application, it is possible to enter a fractional number in the Dependants field, even though this field should only accept whole numbers (integers). 
    The number of dependants should be a non-negative integer, as dependants cannot be float. Allowing float numbers could lead to incorrect data entry and confusion for users.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open the application UI at the following URL:
        https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Benefits
    2. Navigate to the form for adding or editing an employee.
    3. In the Dependants field, enter a float number, such as 2.5.
    4. Submit the form.
    5. Observe that the system accepts the fractional number without validation errors.

Expected Result: 
    The Dependants field should only accept non-negative integers. 
    The user should not be able to enter a fractional number, and an error message should be shown if an invalid input is provided.

Actual Result: 
    The system allows the user to enter and submit a fractional number in the Dependants field without any validation, which can lead to incorrect data entry.
