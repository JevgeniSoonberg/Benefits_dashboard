Title: 
    Login Page Crashes with 405 Error When Invalid Credentials Are Submitted

Description: 
    On the login page (https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Account/Login), if a user submits invalid credentials, the page crashes with a 405 Method Not Allowed error. 
    Instead of displaying an appropriate error message (e.g., "Invalid username or password" or "non-existent user"), the page becomes unresponsive and displays an HTTP error. 
    This behavior disrupts the login process and provides no useful feedback to the user.

Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open the login page at:
        https://wmxrwq14uc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/Account/Login
    2. Enter invalid credentials (e.g., incorrect username and password).
    3. Click the Log In button.
    4. Observe that the page crashes and returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error instead of displaying a proper error message.

Expected Result:
    The page should handle invalid login attempts gracefully by displaying an appropriate error message such as "Invalid username or password" or "non-existent user". 
    The page should not crash or return an HTTP error.

Actual Result:
    The page crashes and returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error with no feedback to the user, preventing further interaction.
